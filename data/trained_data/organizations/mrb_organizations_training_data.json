The\npurpose of the meeting as mentioned in UJV's letter ref [a] is to find solutions to mitigate the impact of the Engineer's\nshutdown on the progress of CP06's package but not just limited to the MRB\u2019s comments on EoT2 and CR/VR topic.\nIndeed, since the Engineer caased its Duties and Authority, UJV has sent to MRB all documents, which are supposed to\nbe reviewed by the Engineer, for MRB's assessment In lieu of the Engineer. However, until the date of this letter, more\nthan one month has passed, UJV has not received any feedback from MRB and has no visibility at all on how MRB will\nmanage the project during the absence of the Engineer services. This has caused further delay in the progress of UJV's\nWorks, for which UJV Is not responsible for and will seek compensation.",

The purpose of the\nCompliance Matrix is therefore not to link each and every document submitted with the corresponding requirements but\nInstead to nk each and every requirement captured with a covering document to ensure that all requirements are\ncovered.

[e]. As a requirement of coordination via interface and construction meetings, UJV updated CP06 B\nactivities based on assumptions of revised access dates and prerequisites which must be completed by CP05\nprior to HOTSA via the letter ref.[c]. However, on 1 March 2021, the CPO5 revised operational target required\nin UJV letter [c] related to access of building 6 for installation of high-pressure washing machine, has not been\nachieved. Therefore, the letter ref. [b] was served to notify and record the delayed milestone of CPO6. It is\nobvious that access from CP05 (Depot Workshop & access fully completed & handed over) to CP06 for Depot\nEquipment activities has been delayed continuously.\n- With regards to PIC question about the impact of site condition with respect to works progress, it is obvious\nthat an access which is not received from CP05 prevents CPO6 activity to start, in the case of this letter the\ninstallation of high-pressure washing machine in building 6.",
